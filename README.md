# FedPet tracking app
### Track your pets feeding schedule with native android notifications

I've built this android app in a couple of weeks as a learning practice to study CRUD concepts, databases and front-end.

The project is built upon the **MAUI Blazor Hybrid app** template, using local sqlite database through sqlite-net-pcl package, native android notifications with a **notification handler built from scratch**, permission requests and alert modals, utilizing bootstrap for the UI.
